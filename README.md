# Helm Charts for Packet

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/packet-labs/helm-charts/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/packet-labs/helm-charts)

Helm Charts for the Packet ecosystem.

Each chart will be in the relevant subdirectory. From the project root, you can install the desired Helm chart, identified by subdirectory name (i.e. `csi-packet`), for example, using:

```bash
helm install --debug --generate-name ./chart-name
```

Some may require a `Secret` object in order to authenticate with Packet's APIs.

## Setup

To use these charts with your Kubernetes cluster, you will need to [have Helm installed](https://v3.helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Some of these charts (for example, `csi-packet`, and `packet-ccm`) also require the existence of a `Secret` on your cluster in order to deploy and configure resources on your Packet account, like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: packet-cloud-config
  namespace: kube-system
stringData:
  cloud-sa.json: |
    {
     "apiKey": "your-api-key",
     "projectID": "your-project-id"
    }
```

This can be applied using a manifest like the above, or managed using [a Helm extension like `helm-secrets`](https://github.com/futuresimple/helm-secrets) before installing charts that requires Packet API authentication. 

## Charts

The following charts are available:

### csi-packet

This configures the [Container Storage Interface implementation for Packet](https://github.com/packethost/csi-packet). To install run:

```
helm install --debug ./csi-packet
```

### packet-ccm
